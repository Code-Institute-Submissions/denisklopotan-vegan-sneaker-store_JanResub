## Validator Testing

### HTML

To check markup validity of Web documents as HTML, we used: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

### CSS

To check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) validity we used: [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://validator.w3.org/).

### Python

To check our Python code against style conventions in PEP 8 we used: [pep8 - Python style guide checker](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/).

Since online validator was not available at this point we needed to install app in our project and perform validation trough terminal.
Documentation [page](https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.7.x/)

...maybe try https://www.pythonchecker.com/ ?

### JavaScript

To detect errors and potential problems in our JavaScript code we used: [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

## Performance Testing

### Lighthouse

"Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps.

When auditing a page, Lighthouse runs a barrage of tests against the page, and then generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as indicators on what you can do to improve your app."

Lighthouse comes integrated by default as part of development tools (DevTools) in Google Chrome browser. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/).

## Browser Testing

We tested website on following browsers:

- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MA13FJ)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

Everything worked correctly.

## Device Testing

Website was tested on these available devices:

- Main working laptop: Lenovo Ideapad 3 Chromebook
- Main smartphone: Google Pixel 6 Pro
- Secondary smartphone: LG V30
