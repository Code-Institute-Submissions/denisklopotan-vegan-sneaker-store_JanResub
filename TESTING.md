## Validator Testing

### HTML

To check markup validity of Web documents as HTML, we used: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

Unfortunately since Django tags are conflicting with standard HTML markup, we could not fix those errors.

### CSS

To check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) validity we used: [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors found.

### Python

For simple python check we used [PythonChecker](https://www.pythonchecker.com/). Most code tested for python logic showed 100%

Additionaly to check our Python code against style conventions in PEP 8 we plan to use: [pep8 - Python style guide checker](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/).

Since online validator was not available at this point we need to install app in our project and perform validation trough terminal.
Documentation [page](https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.7.x/)

### JavaScript

To detect errors and potential problems in our JavaScript code we used: [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

## Performance Testing

### Lighthouse

"Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps.

When auditing a page, Lighthouse runs a barrage of tests against the page, and then generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as indicators on what you can do to improve your app."

Lighthouse comes integrated by default as part of development tools (DevTools) in Google Chrome browser. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/).

Website excelled in performance, while other areas have more room for improvement.
