# Vegan Sneaker Store

## Introduction

Vegan Sneaker Store is something i always wished for when shopping online.
I had hard time finding leather-free shoes or sneakers.
Hence, a perfect idea for project. :)

*project is just in inception, due to my own struggles i could not make it, but still with encouragment from CI and friends i wish to continue and try to make by resubmissions. My apologies for this scarce presentation, wish you a nice day! Cheers :)

## Deployment

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/), Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. - Wikipedia

### Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform designed to host dynamic websites. While Github pages is a great hosting platform for  
projects built entirely with front end languages  like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's not built  
to handle back end languages like Python, which  is why we're using Heroku for this deployment.
