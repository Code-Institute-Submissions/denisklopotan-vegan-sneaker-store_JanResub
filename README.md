# Vegan Sneaker Store

## Introduction

As market for leather-free and sustainable clothing is growing, there was a natural decision to make a website that goes with changing times.
Eating vegetarian myself for decades and being more compassionate towards all life i started to look for alternative options to leather products.  

It was not an easy task at first, it was hard to find leather-free shoes or sneakers that i liked. I would go to local stores to inspect labels, speak with staff and even then, assortment was very limited. Online you would think it would be easier, but in reality most sites did not post full materials list or labels at all! Even big brands. Googling further often brought conflicting informations..  

So it became increasingly difficult and frustrating. Ofc i understood its a new industry, but still...
I was often thinking: "Why is there no big sneaker store with just leather free sneakers??
Time passed, i enrolled in web development course, still with this question popping from time to time.  

Eventually i connected the dots, and hence, a perfect idea was born.. :)

To test the application we performed several categories of testing:
- validator, performance, manual, browser, device and unit testing.

Due to the amount of testing data, testing was moved to separate file.
- Full testing documentation can be found here: [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/), Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. - Wikipedia

### Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform designed to host dynamic websites. While Github pages is a great hosting platform for  
projects built entirely with front end languages  like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's not built  
to handle back end languages like Python, which  is why we're using Heroku for this deployment.
